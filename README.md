# **Module 4 Project**

## Ben Geissel

### Goals:
See if countries around the world will meet the general Paris Climate Agreement emissions goal of cutting 1990 emissions levels by 40% by 2030.
- Fit ARIMA Models for each country
- Predict future emissions
- Compare to Paris Climate Agreement Goals


### Responsibilities:
- ETL on emissions data
- Visualize time series
- Decompose time series
- Stationarity checks
- Differencing for stationarity
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plotting
- Determine AR and MA terms
- Fit ARIMA models
- Check diagnostics
- Validate model fits against actual data
- Forecast future emission levels
- Compare to Paris Climate Agreement Goals
